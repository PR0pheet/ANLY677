**Abstract**



**Introduction** 

  The earliest assistant driving systems appeared in the 1930s. Although the technology was immature at the time, it can be seen that human interest in assistant driving has emerged since then. For example, the existing lane change reminder, the reminder of deviation from the main road, and the detection of traffic lights are also assistant driving applications that people actively explore. Traffic light detection systems are still in the developmental stage in assisted driving. Previously, Tesla has seen cases of "recognizing the tail light of a truck as a traffic light" and "recognizing the moon as a yellow light." This shows that we still need to improve on this technology. We looked at a lot of previous studies. While they used a lot of analysis, most of them only used traditional traffic lights (no directions, no countdowns, or even more complex signs), so we hope this part of the content is to complement and make traffic The light detection system can detect and define a broader range of traffic lights.
